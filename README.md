# Calculator
This project for test purposes only

Things left
- Currently the execution is using left to right approach. Would be best if can follow 'BODMAS' rule (Bracket, Order of power - Not handled yet, Division, Multiplication, Addition, Subtraction)
- Some execution is not correct (Ex : "23 - ( 29.3 - 12.5 )" should be 6.2 but system giving 6.199999999999999)

Some of issue above still not fixed due to insufficient time.
